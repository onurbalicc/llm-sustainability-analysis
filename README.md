# LLM Sustainability Analysis

This project investigates the environmental impact of Large Language Models (LLMs) and explores potential optimization methods for more sustainable AI.

## Objectives
- Estimate energy consumption of training and inference.
- Compare carbon footprint of popular LLMs.
- Test green optimization strategies (quantization, pruning, etc.).

## Tools & Technologies
- Python, pandas
- OpenAI/Meta API (if needed)
- Emission tracking libraries

## Status
ðŸ”§ In development â€“ more updates coming soon!
