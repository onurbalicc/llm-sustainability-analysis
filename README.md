# LLM Sustainability Analysis

This project analyzes the energy consumption of deep learning models using the [BUTTER-E Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pavankumar4757/butter-e-energy-data-for-deep-learning-models), which contains over 1 million experimental runs with watt-level energy readings.

## Goals
- Understand the relationship between model size and energy use
- Identify energy-efficient model configurations
- Provide visual insights for AI sustainability research

## Dataset
- Source: Kaggle
- Name: BUTTER-E
- Size: 1,059,206 measurements

## Next Steps
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering
- Visualization and reporting
